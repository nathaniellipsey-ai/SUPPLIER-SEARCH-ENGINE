  👋 DIRECT TEST - LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING
================================================================================

DATE: December 11, 2025
GOAL: Find out if the click is even being registered

================================================================================
  WHAT WE ADDED
================================================================================

I added a SIMPLE ALERT at the very beginning of openSupplierModal:

  alert('MODAL FUNCTION CALLED - ID: ' + supplierId);

This will:
  1. Fire IMMEDIATELY when you click a supplier
  2. Show a popup with the supplier ID
  3. Tell us if the click handler is working at all

================================================================================
  DO THIS NOW
================================================================================

STEP 1: Upload the updated index.html to GitHub
  (Same as before - pencil icon, copy/paste, commit)

STEP 2: Wait 2-3 minutes for Render deployment

STEP 3: Open incognito mode
  Ctrl+Shift+N

STEP 4: Go to the site
  https://supplier-search-engine.onrender.com

STEP 5: Click on a supplier NAME
  (Not heart, not NOTE, just the NAME)

STEP 6: LOOK FOR ALERT

  EXPECTED:
    Alert popup appears that says:
    "MODAL FUNCTION CALLED - ID: SUP-00001"
  
  If you see this:
    ✅ Click handler IS working
    ✅ Function IS being called
    ✅ Problem is in what happens NEXT
  
  If you DON'T see this:
    ❌ Click handler NOT working
    ❌ onclick attribute not wired correctly
    ❌ OR file didn't upload

STEP 7: Report back with:
  - Did the alert appear?
  - What did it say?
  - Then we'll know where the problem is

================================================================================
  WHY THIS HELPS
================================================================================

RIGHT NOW we don't know if:
  A) The click is registered?
  B) The function is called?
  C) The modal display code is broken?
  D) The file wasn't uploaded correctly?

This simple alert will tell us A and B immediately.

If alert appears but modal doesn't:
  → Problem is in the display code
  → We can fix the specific display issue

If alert doesn't appear:
  → Problem is earlier in the chain
  → Click handler or file upload issue
  → We need different fix

================================================================================
  STEP-BY-STEP UPLOAD
================================================================================

1. GitHub.com > Log in

2. supplier-search-engine repo

3. frontend folder

4. index.html file

5. Click pencil icon (Edit)

6. Local file:
   C:\Users\n0l08i7\Desktop\RENDER REPOSITORY\SUPPLIER-SEARCH-ENGINE\frontend\index.html
   Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C

7. GitHub editor:
   Ctrl+A, Delete, Ctrl+V
   (Paste your updated file)

8. Commit changes:
   Message: "test: Add alert to debug modal"
   Click "Commit changes"

9. Wait 2-3 minutes

10. Test:
    - Incognito: Ctrl+Shift+N
    - Go to: supplier-search-engine.onrender.com
    - Click supplier NAME
    - Look for alert

11. Report:
    - Did alert appear?
    - What did it say?

================================================================================
  DEBUGGING THE ALERT
================================================================================

IF ALERT APPEARS:
  Message: "MODAL FUNCTION CALLED - ID: SUP-00001"
  
  Great! Now we know:
  ✅ File uploaded correctly
  ✅ Click handler working
  ✅ Function being called
  ✅ Problem is in modal display code
  
  Next: Remove alert, add more detailed logging

IF ALERT DOESN'T APPEAR:
  Check:
  1. Are you clicking the SUPPLIER NAME (not heart, not NOTE)?
  2. Are you waiting 2-3 minutes after uploading?
  3. Are you using INCOGNITO mode (no cache)?
  4. Close and reopen incognito
  5. Try different supplier
  6. If STILL nothing: File didn't upload
     Try uploading again

IF ALERT APPEARS BUT SAYS "undefined":
  Alert: "MODAL FUNCTION CALLED - ID: undefined"
  
  This means:
  ❌ onclick is firing but supplierId is not being passed
  ❌ Check onclick HTML: onclick="openSupplierModal('SUP-00001')"
  ❌ Should have quotes around the ID
  ❌ File might not have uploaded correctly
  ❌ Try uploading again

================================================================================
  AFTER YOU REPORT
================================================================================

Once you tell me:
  "Alert appeared and said MODAL FUNCTION CALLED - ID: SUP-00001"

I'll know the issue is in the modal display code and can fix it precisely.

Or if:
  "No alert appeared"

I'll know it's a different issue (file upload or click handler).

================================================================================
  TIMELINE
================================================================================

Now:      Upload updated file
In 3min:  Render deployed
In 5min:  You test and see alert
In 6min:  You report what happened
In 7min:  I have the fix
In 10min: Modal working! 🎉

================================================================================
ACTION: Upload and test, then report the alert message
================================================================================
