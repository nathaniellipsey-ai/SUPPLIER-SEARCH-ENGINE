================================================================================
  WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN CONSOLE
================================================================================

GOOD (means it's working):
  ✅ "openSupplierModal called with ID: SUP-00001 Type: string"
  ✅ "Found supplier: ..."
  ✅ "toggleFavorite called for ID: SUP-00001"
  ✅ "Added to favorites: SUP-00001"
  ✅ "saveNote called for ID: SUP-00001"
  ✅ "Saved note for supplier: SUP-00001"
  ✅ "deleteNote called for ID: SUP-00001"
  ✅ "Deleted note for: SUP-00001"

BAD (means something is wrong):
  ❌ "Modal element not found"
  ❌ "Supplier not found with ID"
  ❌ "Failed to save to localStorage"
  ❌ "userData is null"

If you see BAD messages, copy them and report.

================================================================================
  TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Modal doesn't appear
TRY:
  1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
  2. Clear cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
  3. Close and reopen browser
  4. Check F12 console for error messages
  5. Report any red errors

PROBLEM: Heart doesn't turn red
TRY:
  1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
  2. Click heart
  3. Watch console for updateFavoriteButtons logging
  4. If "Button ID: SUP-00001, IsFavorited: false" shows
      Then the favorite wasn't added
      Check if "Added to favorites" message appears

PROBLEM: Notes button doesn't do anything
TRY:
  1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
  2. Click NOTE button
  3. Check console for:
     openNoteModal called
     Found supplier for note
  4. If modal appears, try typing and saving
  5. Watch console for saveNote and deleteNote logs

PROBLEM: Save/Delete button in notes modal doesn't work
TRY:
  1. Check if onclick attributes have quotes:
     onclick="saveNote('SUP-00001')"  ✓ Correct
     onclick="saveNote(SUP-00001)"     ✗ Wrong
  2. Check F12 console for saveNote/deleteNote calls
  3. If not logged, button wasn't clicked properly
  4. Try F5 refresh and try again
