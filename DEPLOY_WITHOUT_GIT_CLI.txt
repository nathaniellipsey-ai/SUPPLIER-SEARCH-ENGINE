  🚀 DEPLOY WITHOUT GIT CLI - USING GITHUB WEB INTERFACE
================================================================================

DATE: December 11, 2025
STATUS: READY TO DEPLOY

NOTE: Git CLI is not installed, so we'll use GitHub's web interface instead.

================================================================================
  CURRENT STATUS
================================================================================

✅ All fixes are in your local file:
   C:\Users\n0l08i7\Desktop\RENDER REPOSITORY\SUPPLIER-SEARCH-ENGINE\frontend\index.html

❌ Changes are NOT on the server yet (Render)
   Render is still showing old code from last push
   That's why Ctrl+F5 doesn't show changes

🐧 GOAL: Get the updated index.html to the server

================================================================================
  OPTION 1: UPLOAD VIA GITHUB WEB INTERFACE (EASIEST)
================================================================================

STEP 1: Log into GitHub
  1. Go to: https://github.com/login
  2. Enter your username/email and password
  3. Click "Sign in"

STEP 2: Find your repository
  1. Look for your supplier-search-engine repo
  2. Or go to your profile > Repositories
  3. Click on "supplier-search-engine"
  4. Make sure you're on the "main" branch (top left dropdown)

STEP 3: Navigate to frontend folder
  1. In the file list, click folder icon next to "frontend"
  2. You should see: index.html, login.html, my-favorites.html, etc.
  3. Or you can go directly to the file by clicking on index.html

STEP 4: Open the file for editing
  1. Click on "index.html" in the file list
  2. You'll see the file contents
  3. Look for the pencil icon (Edit button) in the top right
  4. Click the pencil icon
  5. GitHub will show: "You're editing a file in a fork"
