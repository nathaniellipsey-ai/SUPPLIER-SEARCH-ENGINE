🔧 SERVER CONFIGURATION FIXED - SWITCHED TO dashboard_with_api.html
==================================================================

Date: 2025-12-15 13:34:56
Issue: Server was connecting to dashboard_standalone.html instead of dashboard_with_api.html
Status: ✅ RESOLVED

📝 FILES UPDATED:

1. ✅ run_server.py (Python Server - Primary)
   - Changed line ~66 to serve dashboard_with_api.html
   - Old: html_file = FRONTEND_DIR / 'index.html'
   - New: html_file = Path(__file__).parent / 'dashboard_with_api.html'
   - This is the MAIN server you're likely using

2. ✅ server.js (Node.js Server)
   - Changed root route (/) to serve dashboard_with_api.html
   - Changed catch-all route (*) to serve dashboard_with_api.html
   - Now points to: path.join(__dirname, 'dashboard_with_api.html')

3. ✅ app.py (Alternative Python Server)
   - Changed root route to serve dashboard_with_api.html
   - Now points to: Path(__file__).parent / 'dashboard_with_api.html'

🚀 HOW TO TEST:

If using Python (run_server.py) - MOST LIKELY:
   python run_server.py
   Then open: http://localhost:3002
   ✅ Should now load dashboard_with_api.html

If using Node.js (server.js):
   node server.js
   Then open: http://localhost:3000
   ✅ Should now load dashboard_with_api.html

If using app.py:
   python app.py
   Then open: http://localhost:3002
   ✅ Should now load dashboard_with_api.html

📊 RESULT:
All three servers now correctly serve 'dashboard_with_api.html' instead of
the frontend/index.html or dashboard_standalone.html variants.

The dashboard_with_api.html file has the full API integration and all
functionality you need.

✨ Next Steps:
1. Restart whichever server you're using
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Navigate to http://localhost:[PORT]
4. Should see the full API-integrated dashboard

🎊 DONE!
