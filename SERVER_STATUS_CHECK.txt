  🔍 CHECK RENDER SERVER STATUS
================================================================================

When you uploaded the file, Render automatically started deploying.
The server might be:
  1. Still building (takes 2-3 minutes)
  2. Built successfully but service restarting
  3. Failed to build
  4. Crashed

Let's check the status!

================================================================================
  STEP 1: CHECK RENDER DASHBOARD
================================================================================

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com

2. Log in if needed

3. Click on "supplier-search-engine" service

4. Look at the top section:
   
   BUILDING: Shows "Building..." or "Deploying..."
   ✅ If you see this: Wait 2-3 minutes
   
   DEPLOYED: Shows "Deployed" with a green checkmark
   ✅ If you see this: Service is running - API should work
   
   FAILED: Shows "Failed" or "Error"
   ❌ If you see this: Build failed - need to check logs
   
   CRASHED: Shows "Crashed" or "Error state"
   ❌ If you see this: Service crashed - need to restart

5. Look at "Logs" section below
   ✅ Scroll through the logs
   ✅ Look for error messages
   ✅ Copy any red error text

================================================================================
  STEP 2: IF STATUS IS "BUILDING"
================================================================================

Just WAIT 2-3 more minutes
Then refresh dashboard
Server will finish building

================================================================================
  STEP 3: IF STATUS IS "DEPLOYED"
================================================================================

Service should be running.
But maybe the API isn't connecting properly.

Try:
1. Go to: https://supplier-search-engine.onrender.com/api/test
2. Should see JSON response:
   {"success": true, "message": "Server is running", ...}

If you see that:
  ✅ Server IS working
  ✅ Problem is frontend code
  ✅ Need to check frontend/index.html

If you see error:
  ❌ Server crashed
  ❌ Look at Render logs
  ❌ Need to restart

================================================================================
  STEP 4: IF STATUS IS "FAILED" OR "CRASHED"
================================================================================

1. In Render dashboard, click "View Logs"

2. Scroll to find RED error messages

3. Copy the error text

4. Common errors:
   
   Error: Cannot find module 'chatbot-service.js'
   → File missing in GitHub
   → Need to upload missing files
   
   Error: Cannot find module 'data-server/data-generator.js'
   → File missing in GitHub
   → Need to upload missing files
   
   Port already in use
   → Service already running
   → Click "Restart" button
   
   Any other error:
   → Report to me with exact error text

================================================================================
  STEP 5: RESTART SERVICE
================================================================================

If service is crashed/failed:

1. Render dashboard > supplier-search-engine

2. Look for "Restart" button (usually top right)

3. Click "Restart service"

4. Wait 1-2 minutes for restart

5. Check status again

6. Try: https://supplier-search-engine.onrender.com/api/test

================================================================================
  WHAT TO REPORT BACK
================================================================================

Tell me:

1. Render dashboard status:
   - Building
   - Deployed
   - Failed
   - Crashed
   - Unknown

2. If there's a status, what does it say exactly?

3. When you try: https://supplier-search-engine.onrender.com/api/test
   What do you see?
   - JSON response with data?
   - Error page?
   - Blank page?
   - Connection refused?

4. Any error messages in Render logs?
   (Copy exact text if yes)

With this info, I can tell you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it!
